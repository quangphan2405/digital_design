The problems are:
- Wrongly named reset signal "tst_n" => "rst_n".
- Not only MSB or LSB of the coordinate is checked,
but also the second MSB or second LSB is considered
for preventing the paddle from escaping. The coordinate
is not changed when the paddle reaches the edges, where
x(7) = x(6) = 1 or x(0) = x(1) = 1. Therefore, it is
allowed to shift when those conditions don't hold.
=> Use two NAND gates for indicating restriction.
